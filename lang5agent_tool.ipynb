            "### 3) 중요한 포인트\n",
            "1.  **데이터 타입 선택 (`double` 사용)**:\n",
            "    *   **정확성**: 평균은 소수점을 가질 수 있으므로, `int`나 `long`과 같은 정수형으로 계산하면 소수점 이하가 버려져 정확한 값을 얻을 수 없습니다. `float`도 부동 소수점 정밀도 문제가 있을 수 있으므로, 대부분의 경우 `double`을 사용하는 것이 가장 좋습니다.\n",
            "    *   **총합 변수**: 합계를 저장하는 변수(`sum`)도 반드시 `double` 타입이어야 합니다. 그렇지 않으면 중간 합계에서 정밀도 손실이 발생할 수 있습니다.\n",
            "2.  **빈 배열 또는 `null` 입력 처리**:\n",
            "    *   `NullPointerException` 방지: `numbers` 배열이 `null`일 경우 `numbers.length`에 접근하면 `NullPointerException`이 발생합니다. 이를 방지하기 위해 `null` 체크를 먼저 해야 합니다.\n",
            "    *   `ArithmeticException` (0으로 나누기) 방지: 배열이 비어있을 경우 (`numbers.length == 0`), 총합을 0으로 나누게 되어 `ArithmeticException`이 발생합니다. 이를 방지하기 위해 배열의 길이가 0인지 확인해야 합니다.\n",
            "    *   **처리 방법**:\n",
            "        *   **예외 발생 (`IllegalArgumentException`)**: 예제 코드처럼 유효하지 않은 입력으로 간주하고 `IllegalArgumentException`을 발생시키는 것이 가장 일반적이고 견고한 방법입니다. 호출하는 쪽에서 이 예외를 처리하도록 강제합니다.\n",
            "        *   **기본값 반환 (0.0 또는 `NaN`)**: 경우에 따라 0.0이나 `Double.NaN` (Not a Number)을 반환할 수도 있지만, 이는 호출하는 쪽에서 반환 값을 명확히 이해하고 처리해야 합니다.\n",
            "        *   `OptionalDouble` 사용 (Java 8 Stream API): Java 8부터 도입된 `OptionalDouble`은 값이 없을 수 있음을 명시적으로 나타내어 `null` 체크나 예외 처리 없이도 안전하게 코드를 작성할 수 있게 돕습니다.\n",
            "3.  **성능 (Performance)**:\n",
            "    *   **반복문**: `for-each` 루프를 사용한 합계 계산은 배열의 크기에 비례하는 시간 복잡도 O(N)을 가집니다. 이는 매우 효율적인 방법입니다.\n",
